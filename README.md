# ReSun & WRF output analysis
Creates .kmz (Google Earth) and .png with geographical data with the results of the ReSun & WRF simulations. Outputs graphs with median daily radiation for the simulated area.

This tool is used to have a critical analysis over the WRF & ReSun results, to study the potencial Solar Energy of that particular area.

Work in progress!!!

## Results:
